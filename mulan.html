				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Mulan</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Mulan is always thinking about others over herself, which is clear from the start 
					when she takes her father's place in the army, literally putting her life on the 
					line for him. She grows in confidence throughout the movie and really begins to 
					believe in her own talents and abilities. The fact she trains and takes it seriously 
					to become the best warrior showcases her dedication.</p>
				</div>

			  <div class="col-sm-6">
			  <div class="card">
				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Li_Shang.jpeg" alt="Li Shang is seen wearing a General's outfit. His long black hair is tied up in the visual.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Li Shang</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Li Shang is the man in charge of the army in Mulan, and because his father is the 
					army general he is desperate to impress. Li Shang takes his role seriously because 
					of that, and at first, he is perhaps a little too strict on the others, but it does 
					allow him to train them into shape.</p>
				</div>

			  <div class="col-sm-6">
			  <div class="card">
				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Mushu.jpeg" alt="Mushu is a tiny red dragon with orange mustache.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Mushu</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">When it comes to Disney sidekicks, Mushu is one of the very best. He's a hilarious character that 
					is full of personality and charisma, which creates a lot of really funny moments throughout the 
					movie with his great one-liners and witty comebacks. While Mushu can be a little bossy and sometimes 
					gives Mulan poor advice, he does ultimately want what is best for her.</p>

				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Crikee.jpeg" alt="Crikee is a pocket size purple cricket with a an expressive face.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Crikee</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Crikee is along for the journey as a lucky cricket to help protect Mulan, and while he doesn't do anything 
					of note to do that, she does stay alive. He's a classic Disney sidekick character who is always looking out 
					for the main hero, doing whatever is needed throughout the movie.</p>

			  <div class="col-sm-6">
			  <div class="card">
				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Chien_Po.jpeg" alt="Chien Po is large bald man seen wearing a light blue outfit.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Chien Po</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Out of everybody that ends up in the army, Chien Po is by far the nicest, as he is always 
					thinking of other people before himself and would much prefer to talk things out rather 
					than fight about any differences. He is kind to Mulan from the start, which isn't the case 
					with all of the characters, and the fact that he hates violence is also a very likable trait.</p>

			  <div class="col-sm-6">
			  <div class="card">
				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Ling.jpeg" alt="Ling has his black hair tied up and can be seen wearing a light brown outfit.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Ling</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Ling is another of the soldiers that Mulan gets close with, and he is the funniest of the trio. Ling is the 
					real joker of the pack, and that allows him to stand out and seem very likable, as he is always trying to 
					cheer other people up.</p>

			  <div class="card">
				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Yao.jpeg" alt="Yao is a short man and can be seen with his black hair tied up in a knot wearing a yellowish brown outfit.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Yao</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Yao is one of three soldiers that Mulan ends up becoming good friends with during the movie, although Yao 
					is one who makes her life difficult at the start. Early on he is a bully and likes to get into fights simply 
					for the sake of it, wanting to show he's the toughest man around.</p>

			  <div class="card">
				<img class="card-img-top" src="images/Mulan_Fa_Zhou.jpeg" alt="Fa Zhou, Mulan's father has grey hair tied up in a knot and wears a blue outfit.">
				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Fa Zhou</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, already fought his war and represented his country, however, when he's called up Fa Zhou 
					has no problem in stepping up and doing it again. Despite the fact he struggles to walk and knows the likely consequences 
					that would come with him going to war again, it's something he is going to do until Mulan steps in.</p>

				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Chi Fu</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Chi Fu is the Emperor of China's advisor.  He's clearly someone who is very loyal and trustworthy. he is a very judgemental 
					person who doesn't really treat Li Shang with any respect, despite the fact he's technically in charge.</p>
				</div>

			  <div class="col-sm-6">
			  <div class="card">

				<div class="card-body">
				  <h3 class="card-title">Shan Yu</h3>
				  <p class="card-text">Shan Yu is simply evil, as the leader of the Hun army, he is set on taking over China and taking down the Emperor at all costs.</p>
